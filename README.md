 **Cycle detection** identifies closed loops where an NFT returns to its original owner within a short period. These cycles are defined as sequences of up to four trades that occur within 30 days, such as **A to B to A** or **A to B to C to A**. From the data analyzed, **2,381 cycles** were detected with a total trading volume of **$8.42 million**, an average of **3.25 trades per cycle**, and a mean duration of **6.38 days**. The presence of such loops strongly indicates potential **wash trading**, as the return to the original address suggests self-trading. Moreover, **637 of these cycles**, accounting for **$2.78 million** in volume, exhibited minimal price variation (below **0.05**), a common sign of artificially inflated trade volumes while maintaining stable prices, a hallmark of **wash trading behavior**.

**Temporal clustering** reveals rapid bursts of NFT trades exhibiting unusual price behavior. These clusters are identified using **DBSCAN clustering** with a **one-hour window**, requiring more than **ten trades per cluster**, with price variances either below **0.05** (indicating stability) or above **100** (indicating extreme volatility). Additionally, **seller overlap** must exceed **50%**, meaning fewer than half of the sellers are unique. The results indicate **745 such clusters** with a total trade volume of **$3.07 million** and an average of **69.3 trades per cluster**, all characterized by extreme price variance. The short time frame of these trades, averaging **2.5 hours per cluster**, along with the repetition of sellers, suggests **coordinated activity**. This high-frequency trading pattern, combined with extreme price movements, points to deliberate **price manipulation** rather than just volume boosting, making it a strong indicator of **wash trading**.

**Community detection** focuses on identifying dense networks of addresses that engage in substantial internal trading. A detected community must include between **5 and 100 addresses**, execute more than **10 trades**, have a trade volume exceeding **$2,000**, and maintain a trade density above **2** (meaning each address is involved in multiple transactions). Additionally, the price variance within these communities must either be very low (below **1**) or very high (above **50**), and at least **30% of the sellers** must be repeated participants.

The analysis uncovered **21 such communities**, with a total volume of **$1.11 million**, an average of **11.19 addresses per community**, and **30.71 trades**. The high internal trade density and repeated sellers suggest coordinated activity, with low-variance communities likely engaging in volume inflation and high-variance ones potentially manipulating prices. These characteristics strongly indicate **collusion**, further supporting the presence of **wash trading** within NFT markets.
